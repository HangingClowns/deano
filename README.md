# Sinatra Template

This is my starter for building Sinatra applications. Take it for what it is.

## Generate a New Application

First download the repo locally:

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/markbates/sinatra-template.git
```

Second run the generate command against the directory you want to create:

```bash
$ ruby PATH/TO/generate.rb awesome_app
```

```bash
$ cd awesome_app
$ bundle
```

That's it! You're new application should be generated.

## Run the Application

```bash
$ cd awesome_app
$ foreman start
```

## Tests

```bash
$ cd awesome_app
$ rake
```
